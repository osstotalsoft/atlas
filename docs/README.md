# About project

Atlas is a graphical interface, built on top of the [Netflix's Conductor](https://netflix.github.io/conductor/), used to create, modify and manage workflows in a very intuitive way, enabling customers to create automated processes without having advanced technical knowledge.

The open source project can be found on [this ](https://github.com/osstotalsoft/atlas)GitHub repository and we are very happy to announce that your contribution would be highly appreciated!  :thumbsup:

Here is an example of a typical workflow built with Atlas:
