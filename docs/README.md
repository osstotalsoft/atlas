{% hint style="success" %}
**Atlas is a graphical interface**, built on top of the [Netflix's Conductor](https://netflix.github.io/conductor/), used to **create**, **modify** and **manage** workflows in a very intuitive way, enabling customers to create automated processes without having advanced technical knowledge.
{% endhint %}

Here is an example of a typical workflow built with Atlas:

### Features

* <mark style="color:green;">**Virtual tour:**</mark> Before starting, a virtual tour will guide you through the principal features and key points, explaining how user should interact with the application.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Easy to draw**</mark>: Create your workflow by just dragging the desired tasks from a list of system tasks, custom tasks, and workflow as tasks and dropping them on the drawing area. Link them and the workflow is ready.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Easy to configure**</mark>: Each type of task can be configured by double clicking its corresponding workflow element, and setting the desired behavior.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**History**</mark>: Atlas helps you to build and edit workflows, being able to revert to a previous version at any time by keeping a history to all the changes. You can compare the current version to any other past versions and rollback to the desired one.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Versioning**</mark>: The workflows can be have versions
* <mark style="color:green;">**Import from file**</mark>: Workflows can be also created based on their JSON configuration. For that, import the file in the application and Atlas draws the corresponding workflow.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Export as JSON**</mark>: Workflow definition can be also stored in JSON files to be used either for back-ups, transfer from one application to another or comparison.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Cloning**</mark>: Once an workflow has been created in Atlas, it can be cloned into another one and work with them as separate independent instances.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Execution**</mark>: After creating and configuring an workflow, you can easily execute it by passing the desired input values. One the workflow was executed, there can be found all the information about the input/output of the execution process.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Easy to navigate**</mark>: It is very simple to navigate from workflow definition to its executions and vice-versa. For every workflow, the Executions panel lists all its executions and which actions can be taken depending on the execution output. On the other side, from the execution details, you can easily navigate to the workflow definition which have been run.
