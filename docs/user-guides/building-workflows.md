### Adding tasks

To add a new task on the canvas, find the element that meets your requirements between System Tasks, Custom Tasks, and Workflows in the left menu and add it to the drawing area using drag and drop. To connect the tasks, drag a line from the out port of one task and drop it to the input port of the other task.

### Fork and JOIN

The 'Fork' function is used to schedule a parallel set of tasks. A Join task is needed to wait for the completion of all the tasks spawned by fork task and aggregate the outputs in a single Json object.

{% hint style="info" %}
A Join Task **MUST** follow a Fork Task
