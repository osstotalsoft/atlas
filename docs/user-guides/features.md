# Features

Here are the main features of the application which make your work easer:

### <mark style="color:green;">**Virtual tour**</mark>

The virtual tour will show for the first time you enter in the application, but it can also be accessed anytime from the edit screen of an workflow:

### <mark style="color:green;">History</mark>

Each time a workflow is being modified, a snapshot is saved, giving us the possibility visualize the definition of an older version, to compare it to the current one or even to rollback to the previous one. &#x20;

To view the history of an workflow, click on the arrow from the right of the screen and open the **History** tab:

In the history list, you can find all the previous versions of the current workflow, that you can **visualize**, **compare** and **rollback** to.

### <mark style="color:green;">Executions</mark>

You can easily navigate to a workflow execution from the edit screen of it's definition. To do that, open the right panel and click on the **Executions** tab.&#x20;

Here is the list of all the executions of the current workflow. You can see their end-time, their status, and you can also do some actions like: **Pause**, **Restart**, **Retry** or **Stop,** depending on their statuses.&#x20;

Click on the workflow id (link) and you will be redirected in the execution screen for a more detailed presentation of the process activity.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">Versioning</mark>

Each workflow can have multiple versions. When creating a new workflow, you are prompted to set a version to it. Also, it can be modified from the workflow **Settings** panel which can be accessed from the **Utilities Bar**

A workflow can be created based on a Json file which can be uploaded in the application.

Also, after creating a workflow definition, you can save it as a Json file.

Provide the name and the version to the new workflow and you are ready to use it as any other workflow.

### <mark style="color:green;">Event Handlers configuration</mark>

Using Atlas, you can define and manage handlers for your events.

### <mark style="color:green;">Tasks configuration</mark>

Besides the System Tasks, provided by the Conductor, we can define in Atlas a custom task type, based on Conductor documentation.
